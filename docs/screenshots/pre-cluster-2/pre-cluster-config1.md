# üß± Baseline (Pre-Cluster) Configuration ‚Äì Secondary SQL Server (Node 2)

## 1. Objective
Establish the baseline configuration of the **Secondary SQL Server** instance before enabling Windows Failover Clustering (WSFC) or Always On Availability Groups.  
Unlike the primary node, this server was **rebuilt from a cloned operating system image and verified to have no existing SQL Server or SSMS installations** prior to setup.  
This ensures parity, reproducibility, and alignment with the primary node before cluster deployment.

> The pre-existing cluster configuration for both nodes can be referenced using the link below üëáüèæ  
> **Note:** The **Disaster Recovery (DR) Server** was cloned, verified clean, and prepared for a new SQL Server Enterprise 2019 installation to ensure a consistent and error-free cluster configuration.

---

## 2. Baseline Verification ‚Äì Post-Clone Environment
Screenshots confirm that **no SQL Server components or SSMS installations** existed on the cloned DR server prior to configuration.  
This validated that the server environment was clean and suitable for a fresh SQL Server 2019 deployment.

### Verification Screenshots

*Figure 1: PowerShell output confirming no SQL Server or SSMS installations present.*

![No SQL Installation](screenshots/pre-cluster-2/no-sql-installed.png)  
*Figure 2: Control Panel ‚Üí Programs and Features showing no SQL Server components installed.*

*Figure 3: Windows search confirming no SSMS detected.*


> These verifications confirm a clean environment before performing the SQL Server Enterprise 2019 installation.  
> The following sections capture the validated baseline configuration prior to cluster feature installation.

## 6. Notes
> This document represents the verified **baseline configuration for the Secondary SQL Server (Node 2)** prior to any SQL or cluster installation.  
> It confirms that the node was cloned from a clean image, validated through PowerShell and system verification, and aligned with enterprise standards in preparation for cluster setup.

---

## 7. Next Steps
1. Install **SQL Server Enterprise 2019** and **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.  
2. Validate SQL installation and service account configuration.  
3. Install **Windows Failover Clustering** feature on both nodes.  
4. Validate inter-node connectivity and DNS resolution.  
5. Create and configure the **Windows Cluster**.  
6. Configure **File Share Witness** on DC01.  
7. Enable and validate **Always On Availability Groups** post-cluster creation.
